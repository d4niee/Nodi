# ðŸ¤– Nodi
Nodi is a Telegram bot for monitoring and Logging your Bitcoin Full-Node. The Bot was designed to be used with the Raspi Blitz Project (see <a href="https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz"><b>here<b></a>)

## Preparation
Before you can start using Nodi you have to create your own Telegram bot (It's free and simple! ðŸŽ‰). Also you need to install nodejs in the System you want to run the bot (Raspi Blitz for example).

### create your own bot using the botfather
The following steps describe how to create a new bot that you can use Nodi

- Contact @BotFather in your Telegram messenger
- To get a token, send BotFather a message that says /newbot
- When asked for a name for your new bot choose something that ends with the word bot. For example, my_test_bot
- If your chosen name is available, BotFather will send you a token
- Save the token for later

### install nodejs

If you run the Bot on your Raspberry Pi with Raspi Blitz you can install Nodejs with following command
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```
This will install the current LTS version of Nodejs

### add your bot to the environment file

Now you have the token for your bot from step one the botfather. In the root directory create a new file .env and paste following into it:
```env
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR TOKEN HERE"
```

## Installation

First you need to clone the Repository and install all required dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/d4niee/Nodi.git
cd Nodi
npm install
```
Running Nodi

Now you can run the Bot
```bash
